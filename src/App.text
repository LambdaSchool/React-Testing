App

state => 
The app should start default with a total of '0'
next should be null 
operation should be null

function => handleClick accepts the state and buttonName as parmaters
^initally not sure how to go about testing this one from the App side.
May have to do the test where the actual props for the buttonName are loated.
Panel uses this function so testing the function maybe better suited on the Panel
